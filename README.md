# Tobacco Use and Mortality (2004â€“2015) - ML Project

ðŸ§¾ About the Project
This machine learning project analyzes the relationship between tobacco use and mortality rates using health data from 2004 to 2015. Smoking-related conditions resulted in 1.7 million hospital admissions in England in 2014â€“2015 alone, highlighting the urgency of predictive health analytics.

## Project Objective
To predict the likelihood of mortality using health data, with a focus on tobacco consumption patterns. This project combines data science techniques with real-world healthcare data to extract actionable insights and build predictive models that could assist in public health decision-making.

## Dataset
 Datasets Used:

**Health Surveys**: NHANES, BRFSS
**Mortality Data**: WHO, CDC
**Tobacco Use Data**: Smoking habits, frequency, type
**Socioeconomic Data**: Age, gender, income, education, occupation
**Health Data**: Pre-existing conditions, lifestyle, healthcare access

## Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **Data Processing & Visualization**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Modeling**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Explainability**: SHAP, LIME  
- **Deployment**: Flask (API), Streamlit / Dash (UI - optional)  
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
### 1. Problem Definition
- Predict mortality risk based on tobacco use and associated factors.
### 2. Data Collection
- Combined surveys, mortality records, and socioeconomic data across several years.
### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaning missing values
- Handling outliers
- Feature engineering (e.g., tobacco use duration, demographics, health access)
### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Histograms, heatmaps, and correlation matrices to visualize relationships
### 5. Model Building
- Classification Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - SVM
  - Neural Networks
### 6. Model Evaluation
- Metrics used:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC

### 7. Model Interpretation
- SHAP and LIME used to interpret feature influence on model predictions

### 8. Deployment
