# 🚭 Tobacco Use and Mortality (2004–2015) - ML Project

🧾 About the Project
This machine learning project analyzes the relationship between tobacco use and mortality rates using health data from 2004 to 2015. Smoking-related conditions resulted in 1.7 million hospital admissions in England in 2014–2015 alone, highlighting the urgency of predictive health analytics.

## 📌 Project Objective
To predict the likelihood of mortality using health data, with a focus on tobacco consumption patterns. This project combines data science techniques with real-world healthcare data to extract actionable insights and build predictive models that could assist in public health decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset
### Source:
The dataset includes tobacco usage and mortality statistics collected from:
- **Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC)**
- **Department of Health (UK)**
- **World Health Organization (WHO)**
- **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**
- **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)**
- **Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **Data Processing & Visualization**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Modeling**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Explainability**: SHAP, LIME  
- **Deployment**: Flask (API), Streamlit / Dash (UI - optional)  
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook
