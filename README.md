# 🚭 Tobacco Use and Mortality (2004–2015) - ML Project
To analyze and predict mortality risks associated with tobacco usage using machine learning models and data-driven insights. This project aims to contribute to public health awareness and support decision-making using statistical modeling and predictive analytics.

This repository contains code, data, and documentation for a machine learning project analyzing the impact of tobacco usage on mortality rates using public health datasets from 2004 to 2015.

## 📌 Project Objective

Predict mortality risks based on tobacco consumption patterns and demographic factors using supervised machine learning algorithms.
