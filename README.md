# Tobacco Use and Mortality (2004–2015) 

About the Project
This machine learning project analyzes the relationship between tobacco use and mortality rates using health data from 2004 to 2015. Smoking-related conditions resulted in 1.7 million hospital admissions in England in 2014–2015 alone, highlighting the urgency of predictive health analytics.

## Project Objective
To predict the likelihood of mortality using health data, with a focus on tobacco consumption patterns. This project combines data science techniques with real-world healthcare data to extract actionable insights and build predictive models that could assist in public health decision-making.

## Datasets Used in This Project
- **Admissions Data**: Hospital admissions due to smoking-related conditions across years.
- **Fatalities Data**: Deaths linked to smoking-related diseases, broken down by diagnosis type, gender, and year.
- **Prescriptions Data**: Trends in pharmacotherapies (NRT, Bupropion, Varenicline) used for smoking cessation.
- **Smoking Prevalence Data**: Distribution of smokers by age group, gender, and year.
- **Health Metrics Data**: Various indicators possibly linked to smoking behavior or health outcomes (e.g., cost, frequency, or public health interventions).
  
## Tools & Technologies
- **Languages**: Python
- **Data Processing & Visualization**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Modeling Evaluation**:Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Score, Classification Report 
- **Machine Learning**: train-test split, Random Forest Classifier  
 - **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Converted year formats
- Standardized numeric columns
- Melted data for flexible analysis

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Admissions**: Identified trends in smoking-related hospitalizations over time.
- **Fatalities**: Analyzed total deaths, gender differences, and smoking-related causes.
- **Prescriptions**: Tracked pharmacotherapy usage and associated costs.
- **Smokers**: Examined smoking prevalence by age group and gender.
- **Metrics**: Investigated annual trends in age-standardized rates and number of deaths.

### 3. Visualization
Used the following plots to derive insights:
- Line plots to show trends over time
- Bar charts to compare categories
- Heatmaps to visualize age-year prevalence and mortality
- Pie charts to show proportion of smoking-related impacts
  
## Key Insights
- Smoking-related admissions and deaths showed a decreasing trend in later years.
- Varenicline (Champix) gained popularity while Bupropion prescriptions decreased.
- Costs for NRT remained consistently high even with reduced prescriptions.
- Smoking prevalence declined across most age groups.
- Males generally had higher smoking prevalence and smoking-related deaths.
